## Leadership Team
* **PI Cogan Shimizu** is an assistant professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research focus
is on knowledge engineering, specifically with KGs, as well as how to use these artifacts
for downstream tasks and as a component in neurosymbolic AI. Furthermore, PI Shimizu is
the PI for central outreach component, EduGate, of the Proto-OKN, thus providing a direct
connection to leverage-able graph expertise across the 17 other teams supported by the program.

* **Co-PI Michael L. Raymer** is a Professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research
interests include pattern recognition, machine learning, and deep neural networks, and topological data
analysis. He most frequently applies these method to problems in bioinformatics and biomedical
informatics. Dr. Raymer has also led and co-led many curriculum reform and pedagogy development
projects including development of the first NSF-funded undergraduate program in bionformatics,
development of innovative mathematics curricula to increase retention and student success in
engineering, and development of culturally-responsive pedagogy to increase success of students from
traditionally under-represented groups in computer science and engineering (funded by AAC&U).

## Resarch Mentorship
* **Natasha Banerjee** is an Associate Professor in Department of CSE at WSU. Her expertise is
in computer vision, HRC, and computer graphics, e.g., for enhancement of robotic awareness
of human preferences during collaboration. Her work has provided the first markerless dataset
on 2-person handover, studies on handover parameters, and novel neural network
algorithms for human grasp, and object repair.

* **Sean Banerjee** is the LexisNexis Endowed Co-Chair for Advanced Data Science and Engineering
and Associate Professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research interests are on using
human behavior data collected using multiview multimodal sensing systems in real and virtual
environments to contribute AI algorithms that show awareness of the nuances of everyday
human-human and human-object interactions for VR security.

* **Lingwei Chen** is an assistant professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research focuses
on addressing trustworthy machine learning issues and real-world data challenges, particularly in
graph and language models. He is the PI for NSF CRII that explores innovative GNNs for attack
detections in data-limited/imbalanced scenarios.

* **Tomojit Ghosh** is currently an assistant professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research
focuses on developing ML algorithms for data visualization, dimensionality reduction,
prediction, and feature selection with an emphasis on biological data sets.
Dr. Ghosh has previously mentored REU students in analyzing biological data using ML.

* **Mumtaz Karatas** is an associate professor in the Department of BIE at WSU. His primary research
focuses on the application of OR/MS techniques, optimization, ML, and data analytics to real world
supply chain, network design, logistics, and defense planning problems.

* **Ashutosh Shivakumar** is an assistant professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research
focus is in HCI and human-machine teaming. He is specifically interested in utilizing Extended
Reality (AR/VR) technologies to develop advanced data-driven tools to enhance skill acquisition in
fields such as healthcare and education.

* **Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan** is a full professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. His research
focus has been on Semantic Analysis of Social, Text and Sensor Data using AI/ML/NLP, as well as
Knowledge Represeantation and Reasoning. Recently, he has been investigating foundations of
LLMs in terms of semantics of embeddings and logic-based reasoning.

* **Thomas Wischgoll** is a full professor and the NCR Endowed Chair in the Department of CSE at
WSU. His research interests include scientific visualization, flow and scientific visualization, virtual
environments and display technology, as well as biomedical imaging and visualization.

* **Wen Zhang** is an assistant professor in the Department of CSE at WSU. Her research areas are
interdisciplinary on IoTs, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Networking, as well as Smart & Connected
Systems, with a particular dedication to Energy Harvesting and Embedded Devices.
