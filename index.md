# Knowledge Graphs and Knowledge Networks

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) (e.g., ChatGPT for human-like conversations
or Midjourney for fantastical image generation) has taken the public zeitgeist by storm.
However, for all their prodigious performance, they have significant downsides. Confabulation, more
widely known as hallucination, is a byproduct of the underlying models in these sorts of AI.
One of the mechanisms to combat such confabulation, as well as overall augmenting the capacity
of any sort of AI, not just GenAI, to support niche or domain science, is the principled integration of
symbolic resources into AI models. This class of models, where neural learning and
representation are tightly coupled with symbolic learning and representation is known as neurosymbolic AI
(NeSy AI). Neurosymbolic AI techniques are poised to address many of the underlying
research challenges in the AI field, especially as it pertains to the acceleration of science and
discovery. Neurosymbolic agents (i.e., programs or applications that implement neurosymbolic
AI techniques to accomplish specific or generalized tasks) encapsulate a tight integration of
symbolic (e.g., knowledge representation) and subsymbolic (e.g., machine/deep learning or statistical)
methods to approach human level cognition and perform relevant tasks.

One common mechanism for symbolic learning and representation – especially in a human
interpretable manner – is the use of ontologies, and a related structure known as knowledge
graphs (KGs). They have quickly become a major paradigm supported by a broad set
of methods and tools for the creation, extraction, integration, representation, and visualization of
data, and supported by long-established W3C standards and recommendations. For
Linked Data alone, which is but one form of a knowledge graph, a 2017 count showed more
than 35 billion node-edge-node information triples freely available on the web. Schema.org
data also constitutes a massive knowledge graph, as already in 2015 over 30% of web pages had
the corresponding markup. We may also consider Wikipedia. It is fairly easy to remark on
the significant impact that Wikipedia has had on the sheer magnitude of easily accessible
knowledge available to the average person. Wikidata provides the same experience, but prioritizes
a machine-readable format that makes it easy for data infrastructure to ingest.

Due to this proliferation of these semantic resources, as well as the growing focus on their ability
to improve AI models (including curtailing hallucination in popular GenAI models), new computer
science and engineering graduates are frequently expected to have some facility in the standards
and resources for knowledge graphs, and the techniques necessary for integrating them into NeSy
AI models.

In this proposed REU Site: (Knowledge) Graphs and (Knowledge) Networks, we have curated a
set of research projects that revolve around the leveraging of symbolic information (in the forms
of graphs and networks) to improve the outcomes of machine learning (ML) and AI applications,
all across a variety of disciplines. Due to the highly integral nature of
graphs and networks (and graph and network data), there is clear complementary overlap in the
different research fields in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Wright State
and beyond. Indeed, the Leadership and Research Mentorship teams for this project
comprise 75% of research-active faculty in the department.
